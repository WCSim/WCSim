# This macro file is used to visualized the geometry of detectors with RayTracer.
# The output of the macro file will be three .jpeg files titled g4RayTracer.jpeg, g4RayTracer1.jpeg, and g4RayTracer2.jpeg.
# The .jpeg files show the geometry of the detector from different viewpoints.

## Errors may arise if using RayTracer and attempting to view the detector from a distance further than 40 meters
## If this occurs, attempt changing the y-direction
