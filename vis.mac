# Default config if you do nothing is currently SuperK

# The tube size is fixed for SK to 20"
# These are fixed geometries for validation
#/WCSim/WCgeom SuperK

# Some other SuperK options:
#/WCSim/WCgeom SuperK_20inchPMT_20perCent # Note: the actual coverage is 20.27%
#/WCSim/WCgeom SuperK_20inchBandL_20perCent # Note: the actual coverage is 20.27%

#/WCSim/WCgeom SuperK_20inchBandL_14perCent # Note: the actual coverage is 13.51%

# Cylindrical detector with a height of 60 m and a diameter of 74 m
#/WCSim/WCgeom Cylinder_60x74_20inchBandL_14perCent # Note: the actual coverage is 13.51%
#/WCSim/WCgeom Cylinder_60x74_20inchBandL_40perCent

# Generic cylindrical detector with a height of 100m and a

#/WCSim/WCgeom Cylinder_12inchHPD_15perCent # Note: the actual coverage is 14.59%

#/WCSim/WCgeom HyperK #default length is 49500 mm unless changed below.

#Added for detector length option (ONLY FOR HYPER-K GEOMETRY!!) 2014/07/29. This simulates a segment of the Hyper-K detector of a given length. 

#/WCSim/HyperK/waterTank_Length 49500. mm # Equivalent length for 5 partitions(ie. will simulate a detector 1/10 of the HK length)
#/WCSim/HyperK/waterTank_Length 61875. mm # Equivalent length for 4 partitions
#/WCSim/HyperK/waterTank_Length 82500. mm # Equivalent length for 3 partitions
#/WCSim/HyperK/waterTank_Length 123750. mm # Equivalent length for 2 partitions
#/WCSim/HyperK/waterTank_Length 247500. mm # Equivalent length for 1 partition

#Added for the PMT QE option 08/17/10 (XQ)
# 1. Stacking only mean when the photon is generated
# the QE is applied to reduce the total number of photons
# 2. Stacking and sensitivity detector
# In the stacking part, the maximum QE is applied to reduce 
# the total number of photons
# On the detector side, the rest of QE are applied according to QE/QE_max
# distribution. This option is in particular important for the WLS
# 3. The last option means all the QE are applied at the detector
# Good for the low energy running.

#this is a temporary workaround for needing to construct the dark noise messenger (done in the old digitizer / new adddarknoise class) before the dark noise options below are read
#this workaround can be removed after a forthcoming major code change:
# - removal of old WCSimWCDigitizer
#then this can be removed by:
# - construct WCSimWCAddDarkNoise instance in the WCSimEventAction constructor
# - remove any references to /DAQ/Construct in WCSimWCDAQMessenger
# - make WCSimEventAction::CreateDAQInstances() private
# - call WCSimEventAction::CreateDAQInstances() in BeginOfEventAction() (actually already there, but need to test to make sure the instances are created early enough)
