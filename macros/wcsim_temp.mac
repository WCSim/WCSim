## GEOMETRY

## select the geometry
/WCSim/WCgeom HyperK_20perCent ## Uses 20" B&L PMTs

/WCSim/Construct # This must be uncommented in order to construct a new detector configuration. 

#Added for the PMT QE option 08/17/10 (XQ)
# 1. Stacking only mean when the photon is generated
# the QE is applied to reduce the total number of photons
# 2. Stacking and sensitivity detector
# In the stacking part, the maximum QE is applied to reduce
# the total number of photons
# On the detector side, the rest of QE are applied according to QE/QE_max
# distribution. This option is in particular important for the WLS
# 3. The last option means all the QE are applied at the detector
# Good for the low energy running.

## DARK NOISE 

/DarkRate/SetDetectorElement	tank

# default dark noise frequency (and conversion factor) is PMT property (NEW), set in the code.
# Below gives possibility to overwrite nominal values, eg. to switch OFF the Dark Noise.
#/DarkRate/SetDarkRate 0 kHz   #Turn dark noise off
#/DarkRate/SetDarkRate 4.2 kHz #This is the value for SKI set in SKDETSIM.
#/DarkRate/SetDarkRate 3.0 kHz #For 12 inch HPDs and Box and Line PMTs, based on High QE 20" R3600 dark rate from EGADS nov 2014
#/DarkRate/SetDarkRate 8.4 kHz #For 20 inch HPDs and Box and Line PMTs, based on High QE 20" R3600 dark rate from EGADS nov 2014  # pg 13/14 of https://indico.ipmu.jp/event/326/contributions/5005/attachments/3186/4082/20200519_BLPMT_Nishimura.pdf
/DarkRate/SetDarkRate 5 kHz

# Select which time window(s) to add dark noise to
#/DarkRate/SetDarkLow to /DarkRate/SetDarkHigh [time in ns]
#/DarkRate/SetDarkMode #  adds dark noise hits to a window of
/DarkRate/SetDarkMode 0 # to add dark noise to a time window starting at

#width /DarkRate/SetDarkWindow [time in ns] around each hit
#i.e. hit time Â± (/DarkRate/SetDarkWindow) / 2
/DarkRate/SetDarkLow  0
/DarkRate/SetDarkHigh 1000
