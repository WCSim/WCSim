#/WCSim/Construct # This must be uncommented in order to construct a new detector configuration. 

#Added for the PMT QE option 08/17/10 (XQ)
# 1. Stacking only mean when the photon is generated
# the QE is applied to reduce the total number of photons
# 2. Stacking and sensitivity detector
# In the stacking part, the maximum QE is applied to reduce
# the total number of photons
# On the detector side, the rest of QE are applied according to QE/QE_max
# distribution. This option is in particular important for the WLS
# 3. The last option means all the QE are applied at the detector
# Good for the low energy running.

#this is a temporary workaround for needing to construct the dark noise messenger (done in the old digitizer / new adddarknoise class) before the dark noise options below are read
#this workaround can be removed after a forthcoming major code change:
# - removal of old WCSimWCDigitizer
#then this can be removed by:
# - construct WCSimWCAddDarkNoise instance in the WCSimEventAction constructor
# - remove any references to /DAQ/Construct in WCSimWCDAQMessenger
# - make WCSimEventAction::CreateDAQInstances() private
# - call WCSimEventAction::CreateDAQInstances() in BeginOfEventAction() (actually already there, but need to test to make sure the instances are created early enough)
