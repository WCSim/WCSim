Current notes and how to build:

You should have a recent and working version of
ROOT and GEANT4.  (Known to work with GEANT 4.9.4.p01.)
You also need all of the G4 data files including
hadron xsecs etc.  Those are the only requirements.  The code should
work with gcc 4.3.

To compile:
make clean
make rootcint
make

If you want to use these libraries with an external program then also do:

make shared      [ For root programs]
make libWCSim.a  [ Also necessary for the event display?]

More detailed information about the simulation is available in doc/DetectorDocumentation.pdf.
