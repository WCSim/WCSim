# Choose the physics list.  
# Physics lists are described in the Geant4 documentation at 
# http://geant4.cern.ch/support/proc_mod_catalog/physics_lists/physicsLists.shtml

#
# The list of available physics lists is output during WCSim initialization.
# A "WCSim" physics list option is removed in versions later than WCSim1.6.0
# uncomment one line below to choose the physics list
#
#/WCSim/physics/list QGSP_BIC_HP #preferred for energies below 5 GeV
#/WCSim/physics/list LBE # preferred for low-background experiments.  
/WCSim/physics/list FTFP_BERT # recommended for high energy physics and hadron production up to beam momentum of several tens of GeV/c.
