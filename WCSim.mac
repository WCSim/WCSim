## select the geometry
# Default config if you do nothing is currently SuperK
# If you do use a geometry other than SuperK, then you *must*
#  uncomment the line /WCSim/Construct after the chosen geometry
#  and all other geometry related commands
#  or you'll get a seg fault or wrong results

#some geometries can be tuned by config file options
# it is important to do things in the correct order
#/WCSim/WCGeom GEOM to set the defaults
#/WCSim/commands to modify the defaults
#/WCSim/Construct

#Use the standard SK geometry
# no extra commands required


#Use the nuPRISM geometry w/ mPMTs DEPRECATED (use IWCD_mPMT_WithOD below)

## OR for single mPMT mode or updating mPMT parameters:

#Note that whilst you can change the number of PMTs
# in the HK FD ID using these photocoverage parameters,
# it is up to you to verify that you have produced
# a valid geometry.
#Suggestions of things to check
# - Has an extra tower of PMTs been built?
#   (Check this via the std error stream)
#   This can cause tracks to get stuck & be killed
# - Is the layout of the ID PMTs (20" + OD) sensible?
#   (Plot the position of each PMT. See $WCSIMDIR/sample-root-scripts/plot_pmts.C)
#   When there is e.g. a low number of mPMTs
#   unrealistic stripes of mPMTs are produced
#   that may cause odd output
# - Is the number of hits consistent with expectation?
#   For example, compare the number of hits per PMT
#   using the default geometry with your geometry
#   using e.g. a particle gun with sufficient statistics

#Added for the PMT QE option 08/17/10 (XQ)
# 1. Stacking only mean when the photon is generated
# the QE is applied to reduce the total number of photons
# 2. Stacking and sensitivity detector
# In the stacking part, the maximum QE is applied to reduce
# the total number of photons
# On the detector side, the rest of QE are applied according to QE/QE_max
# distribution. This option is in particular important for the WLS
# 3. The third option means all the QE are applied at the detector
# Good for the low energy running.
# 4. Switch off the QE, ie. set it at 100%

## It should be noted that only one /mygen/generator can be run
## at once.

## (e.g. from NEUT)
#/mygen/generator rootracker
#/mygen/vecfile vector_neg_1e22_HK_Tochibora_LBL2019Mar_0099.root

## Or you can use the G4 Particle Gun

## Or you can use the datatable option
## This is similar to the nuance format option, though this uses datatable formatted files.
## Datatables are formatted as follows:
## | Index of particle in event | PDG code | Energy | X | Y | Z | Px | Py | Pz | Time |
##Â Note that the column separators "|" are for clarity in describing the format, and should not be included in the file
## Note also that comments are allowed in the data table file by starting lines with a "#"

# TRACKING
##################
## Commands to control which true particle tracks are tracked and saved to the output file:
## By default, save all tracks in the chain from primaries to those that produce Cherenkov photons that produce hits
## To disable this behaviour and only save tracks of particular creation processes and particle types, set to false
#/Tracking/saveHitProducingTracks false
## By default, all electrons, muons, pions, kaons, protons and neutrons are saved, and particles created by Decay, conv,
## nCapture or OpWLS processes
## Add additional PDG codes of particle types or additional Geant4 process names of creation processes of tracks to save
## Note that optical photons have PDG code 0 in Geant4
#/Tracking/trackParticle 0
#/Tracking/trackProcess Cerenkov
## Due to the typically very large number of optical photons, a fraction can be tracked by setting the percentage to randomly draw
## Note that the value is a percentage from 0.0 to 100.0, not fraction 0.0 to 1.0

# NUMBER OF EVENTS TO RUN
##################
# It is possible to perform multiple runs of WCSim in a single process
# The benefit of this is to reduce the time spent on WCSim initialisation
# in a use case e.g. simulating events at multiple source positions
# In order to do this, you can repeat the /run/beamOn command e.g.
# /gun/direction -1 0 0
# /run/beamOn 2
# /gun/direction 1 0 0
# /run/beamOn 3
# However, be warned that you cannot change all options between runs
# - All parameters in tuning_parameters.mac and jobOptions.mac changed will have no effect
# - Some parameters in WCSim.mac may not have an effect (e.g. geometry)
# - It is up to you to perform the bookkeeping of which events were run with which options, but to help with this:
# -- The options tree will be filled with one entry for each run
# -- The EventHeader has a run number that specifies the run (and corresponding options tree entry) for a given event
# It is therefore your responsibility to confirm that the options you are changing work as expected in multi-run mode
